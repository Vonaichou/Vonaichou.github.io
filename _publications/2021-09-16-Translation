**Abstract** <br>

This study considers translation as a joint enterprise in the management of both linguistic translation and associated meaning-making resources in English language teacher talk from a translanguaging perspective. Analysis of classroom teaching in Chinese universities using conversation analysis (CA) under the SETT (self-evaluation of teacher talk) framework reveals that the sequential patterns of translation go beyond the linguistic structure and are assimilated into a translanguaging pedagogical frame in alignment with dynamic L2 classroom modes. The findings contribute to an understanding of translanguaging effect within certain L2 classroom contexts. As such, the research further informs the appropriate use of translation/translanguaging practice to develop classroom interactional competence.
