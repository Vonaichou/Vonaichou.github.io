This essay discusses the translation of Huidong fishing songs, an integral part of China's Intangible Cultural Heritage from Guangdong Province, through the lens of cultural translation theory. It underscores the role of translation in enhancing global understanding and appreciation of Southern China's cultural identity. Emphasizing the translator's role as a cultural mediator, the paper explores strategies for culturally sensitive translation, including cultural contextualization and adaptation. This approach ensures that translations resonate authentically with global audiences while preserving the songs' cultural essence. The paper highlights translation as a crucial tool for cultural preservation and intercultural communication, fostering empathy and respect across cultural boundaries. It concludes by affirming the significance of translating Huidong fishing songs in bridging cultural divides and enriching global cultural dialogue.
